#C42 1.1o

There're all fixes and improvements:
- Source code's been rewrited (exceptions, conditions, classes, optimization etc.). Now code is more readable than before.
- The enter block's been changed from `1` to `main` (bcs before I thought that name of the block could be only integer number, but I realized that it's not)


(the changelog isn't ready yet, bcs I still working on this version)
